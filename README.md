# Plot: All the White girls are sitting with their heads down, really down, pointing at the floor. Down down pointing with their eye balls down at their phone screens which were looking up up up, up, up, again (repeat up and down to reset your human calibration settings without much resistence to finally fine tune the resistence).

# I can't tell you what happened at the store, because you had to be there. I got a sale without buying anything. The sale, was, a, feeling, all, over, my, body, . I got the sale. I got the . 

This story was written for one type of person, one type of personality. For a woman, to be exact. Like a woman. But, for a woman. However, it was for a woman. Not like that, a woman. This is for a woman.

Egirl S: Oh, you mean the one with the catchy beat and those mesmerizing visuals? Yeah, I'm obsessed with it. It's been stuck in my head all day.

<img src="https://github.com/nathanielburman/horror-fiction-back-from-the-sale-part-x/blob/main/i12342343mages.jpg"></img>
Egirl Z: (nods) Yeah, that one! It's like the anthem of the moment. I can't escape it, not that I want to.

Egirl F: Seriously, though, the production quality is insane. It's like the perfect blend of beats and melody. I feel like I'm in a music video whenever it plays.

Egirl S: (laughs) Right? Imagine if our lives had soundtracks. This would be the song for our car rides.

Egirl Z: (smirks) Our own personal music video. I can already picture it. Neon lights, cityscapes, the whole shebang.

Egirl F: (points to the car's surround sound system) Good thing we're fully connected to this system. It's like we're in our own little music bubble.

Egirl S: (turns up the volume) Let's crank it up a bit more! I want to feel the bass in my bones.

Egirl Z: (laughs) Living for the surround sound experience. It's almost like we're at a concert, but in the comfort of our own car.

Egirl F: (singing along) I bet people passing by can hear us. Who cares, though? It's all about the vibes!

Egirl S: (laughs) We're the ultimate car karaoke crew. Someone should make a reality show about us.

Egirl Z: (grins) "Egirls on the Go." I like the sound of that. Now, let's keep riding and vibing to the beats!

...

Egirl F could really feel it in her bones. Egirl F feels it in her bones as her bones vibrate more and more to the bass in the music and ber bones vibrate until they explode and her whole body dissapears into a mist of blood with a light in the center that sparked out more than anything.

...

Egirl S was right in the middle of her kareoke singing when F went mental. The vibration of that was mental.

...

In the car, with the AC running, and the sun outside scortching, Where there once was the light of a spark, there was a dark nothing instead. It becomes a construct of an idea and it enters the soul and spirit of Egirl S and Egirl Z. The idea is that they will leave the car now, and run inside and tell thheir friends that Egirl F is dead.

...

## Z powers up on a soul that was found wandering up the stairs to heaven. Wanding up and around the stairway to heaven is frounded upon by many scholars. 

# A Egirl Z - in a cat cosplay is crawling on the floor in a not sexual manner which is reminescient of an image of a woman saving her life. Blood splatters across her face. Her lips blood red and stained.

# Act 3
## Her phone in her hand. The image flashes her bank account balance. An imbalance ocurrrrs Whoa. Did you feel that? Her bank account shifted in time. But the people on the TV.  No. Not TV. I said, the people on the phone! Your not listening again! are you here right now? Hello! What?

## Title: Echoes of Eternity

In the mystical realm of Eldoria, where magic and reality intertwine, lived a young sorceress named Seraphina. Seraphina possessed an extraordinary gift â€“ the ability to weave illusions that blurred the lines between life and death. Little did she know that her powers would lead her on a journey through the veil of existence itself.

One fateful day, as Eldoria was enveloped in an otherworldly twilight, a powerful ancient artifact known as the Ephemeral Mirror was uncovered. Legend spoke of its ability to reflect the essence of one's mortality, revealing the deepest fears and dreams hidden within.

Intrigued by the mirror's lore, Seraphina, accompanied by her loyal companion, a mystical cat named Luna, ventured into the heart of Eldoria to find it. Guided by cryptic whispers and shimmering illusions, she reached the Mirror's resting place within the Enchanted Grove.

As Seraphina gazed into the Ephemeral Mirror, a surreal dance of lights and shadows unfolded. She saw herself in a myriad of alternate realities, each one depicting a different facet of her existence. In one reflection, she witnessed triumph and joy; in another, sorrow and despair.

Suddenly, the room trembled, and the Mirror's surface rippled with an otherworldly energy. Seraphina found herself entwined in a luminous thread, her essence connecting with the reflections within the mirror. The boundary between life and death blurred as the Mirror extracted the very essence of her being.

...

Seraphina died. A state of existence where the character's essence was tethered to the mirror did happen, forever bound to the reflections within. But death was forever in this realm.

Death of Seraphina was this way for thousands of years. Stories only of Serafinas death were told. Much like the stories of Jesus for 2000 years. Tales of Seraphina's death were told for thousands of years. Then something happened in death.

...

As Seraphina explored this ethereal realm, she encountered echoes of her own emotions and experiences. Joyful laughter and haunting whispers resonated, creating a surreal tapestry of her existence. Though she hadn't physically perished, Seraphina had transcended the conventional boundaries of life.

The story unfolds as Seraphina grapples with her newfound existence, learning to navigate the echoes of eternity within the Ephemeral Mirror. The line between reality and illusion blurs, and she discovers that even in Death 1, the journey of self-discovery continues, offering glimpses into the profound mysteries of her own soul.

# Act 4
## She hugs her family. And protected them. She stands there with her family knowing that she protected them and she disapears into the camera.

## At the end of the story you should imagine a person who is running a business at the end of the day and the sun is setting. The person's name is Prices. Dont' get in the way of the Price Cutter! Price Vs Price Cutter in a twist of fate for the blind. Who will win, and what will happen with the dames? Nobody knows because knowbody cares. Its a delusion to think that they got a real sale.
